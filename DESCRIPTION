Description: 
    Correspondence analysis (CA) is a matrix factorization method, and is 
    similar to principal components analysis (PCA). Whereas PCA is designed for 
    application to continuous, approximately normally distributed data, CA is 
    appropriate for non-negative, count-based data that are in the same additive scale. 
    The corral package implements CA for dimensionality reduction of a single matrix of 
    single-cell data, as well as a multi-table adaptation of CA that leverages 
    data-optimized scaling to align data generated from different sequencing platforms 
    by projecting into a shared latent space. corral utilizes sparse matrices and a 
    fast implementation of SVD, and can be called directly on Bioconductor objects 
    (e.g., SingleCellExperiment) for easy pipeline integration.
    The package also includes the option to apply CA-style processing to 
    continuous data (e.g., proteomic TOF intensities) with the Hellinger distance
    adaptation of CA.
